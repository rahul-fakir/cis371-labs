2017-03-15 6:30pm: At Office Hours we got help with fleshing out the schematic and figuring out how stalling comes into play.
2017-03-16 7:00pm: Went to OH to get help on the schematic. We discussed with Andy how to diagram bypassing. On ething to remember is that there are really only four types of bypasses that we are concerned with and for each one we can use a bypass module that outputs the necessary mux selectors 

2017-03-20 6:00pm: At Office Hours we got help with figuring out if our logic for propegating logic down the pipeline through many Nbit_reg modules was a good/proper way to go about things.
2017-03-21 7:00pm: At Office Hours we got help with some of our bypass logic, we forgot to include a mux for WD bypass. Also we were having issues with our PC being off and we realized that we were delaying the whole pipeline a cycle by including an unnecessary latch in fetch stage. 
2017-03-22 8:30pm: At Office Hours we got help debugging an issue where "regfile_data" was wrong in the tests. The issue was that the wrong register was being written. We had the the register file using the WE and the RD selector from the wrong stage.
